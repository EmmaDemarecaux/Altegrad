   In September 2018, Algodone joined the Cybersecurity program called
   Cyber@StationF. Managed by Thales and hosted in StationF the worldâ€™s
   largest Start-up campus, this program accelerates promising start-ups
   in the Cybersecurity Space over 6 months.

   Algodone was selected along another 10 start-ups from France, Israel,
   the US, the UK and Singapore after a rigorous selection process managed
   by Thales specialists in Cybersecurity.

   While we are not a Cybersecurity company in the strict sense, Algodone
   uses Cybersecurity concepts and algorithms in our technology and
   solutions. As a result, Algodoneâ€™s Silicon Activation Licensing
   Technology (SALTâ„¢) is one of the most reliable and secure solutions
   that allow secure IP tracing (SALTâ„¢ Trace), dynamic chip configuration
   (SALTâ„¢ Config) and deploying pay-per-use business model for innovative
   technologies (SALTâ„¢ Meter).

   In September we started meeting with various Thales business units, key
   Thales executives including Thales CEO Patrice Caine. This started what
   can be described as a dating process with Algodone trying to understand
   Thales businesses and Thales looking at what Algodone can offer.

   Fast forward 7 months to April 2019 at the conclusion of the program,
   the results have been impressive:
     * We have worked very closely with Thales Research and Technology
       teams to co-develop key innovative technology for a next generation
       product and completed a joint Proof of Concept.
     * We have participated in 20 various Thales internal and external
       events amongst which the FIC (Forum International de la
       CybersÃ©curitÃ©) and Thales T-Days (Annual meeting of Thales
       Management), culminating in the â€œDemo Dayâ€ where all start-ups
       presented to internal and external audience the results of the
       program.
     * We have identified 4 potential long ranging use cases and are
       currently working on 2.

   All of these were made possible by the relentless efforts of Antonin
   and Rebecca at Thales Digital Factory managing the program as well as
   our Thales coaches Arnaud and Thierry.

   A few lessons learned from our perspective:
     * Small start-ups and large corporations have different agendas and
       time urgency: a start-up needs to make money as quickly as it can,
       a week which gets by without progress is a lost week and
       opportunities; in a big corporation however, time is planned in
       weeks or months ahead; relationships and projects are built step by
       step so the end result can be very solid. From this perspective,
       both sides should take the difference into consideration when
       setting goals and executing towards the short finish line (6
       months).
     * Small start-ups have resource limitation. Much like software
       licensing that is applicable to all kinds of software products,
       Algodoneâ€™s Silicon Activation Licensing Technology is also a
       fundamental technology that can be used in many diverse use cases
       where we basically transmit any sensitive information over
       non-secure mean of communication remotely. While this is very
       attractive to many customers and has generated broad interests, we
       realized as a start-up we cannot spread our limited resource thin
       to many projects at the same time. We have to select the right
       project to focus on to ensure customer success.
     * Changing mindset and business model takes time and acceptance from
       higher management. We have a solid technology and rarely met anyone
       challenging our technology, what really hold them back was the fact
       that we are changing and innovating business models from
       product-profit margin to service-ongoing value proposition. Hence
       to make a case, we have to aim high in management and try changing
       peopleâ€™s mindset, gaining their agreement that this is where the
       semiconductor industry will go, and ultimately rewriting the plan
       for the next season plan to incorporate SALTâ„¢. This takes time.

   The lessons we have learned at Station F are the same lessons we
   encounter each day in normal business activities, all being part of the
   challenges of bringing innovating technologies and business models to
   the market. The short-span of the Station F program simply condensed
   these experiences and made us more acutely aware of these differences.

   At the conclusion of the program, not only have we made promising
   technology advancement and collaboration with Thales, we are also
   better equipped to handle some of these challenges in the real world.
   If someone asks me the question: given what you know today would you do
   the Thales Cyber@StationF program again, the answer is a short
   resounding YES.

   We are sincerely grateful to the community and all involved for making
   this program a success. Good luck to Cyber@StationF 2019!
