Why download Java?

   Java technology allows you to work and play in a secure computing
   environment. Upgrading to the latest Java version improves the security
   of your system, as older versions do not include the latest security
   updates.

   Java allows you to play online games, chat with people around the
   world, calculate your mortgage interest, and view images in 3D, just to
   name a few.
