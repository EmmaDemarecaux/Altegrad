From Sheep to Dress â€“ Da ovelha ao vestido

   November 18, 2018
   tags: dress, fiar, handspun, knitting, lÃ£, LÃ£ portuguesa, Portuguese
   wool, spinning, tricot, vestido, wool

   This is my first 100% hand spun dress. I made it from finely spun
   single-ply Portuguese Merino, to which I added a few bits of hand dyed
   silk/merino roving I got during a sale. There are various tones of blue
   and pink alternated with rich golden oranges. This was 2 year project,
   from start to finish. It is very light and warm and I am extremely
   happy with the shape of it. Overall, this is a really happy ending to a
   mammoth of a project. Technical details here.

   Este Ã© o meu primeiro vestido 100% feito por mim. O fio Ã© de merino
   portuguÃªs, lavado e fiado por mim, misturado com bocadinhos de
   seda-merino pintada que tinha comprado. As cores vÃ£o do roxo ao azul,
   intercalados com tons de dourado. Demorei 2 anos, do princÃ­pio ao fim.
   Ã‰ muito fino, leve e quente e gosto imenso do corte. O tecido tem
   resistido bem ao uso. Houve momentos em que isto me pareceu um projecto
   demasiado ambicioso â€“ mas nunca me pareceu demasiado complicado. E a
   verdade Ã© que saiu melhor que a encomenda. Detalhes aqui.

Riddari â€“ My First Lopapeysa

   November 18, 2018
   tags: camisola, Iceland, IslÃ¢ndia, knitting, lÃ£, lopapeysa, sweater,
   tricot, wool

   Processed with VSCO with a6 preset

   It was in progress here. I finally finished it in August and left it in
   Portugal, with its new owner. The photos were taken in a hurry, and
   they donâ€™t do justice to the subtle natural grayish brown of the
   sweaterâ€™s body, but they show off the yoke pattern (which I adapted
   from the original model to use only three colors). Its my first
   lopapeysa, but not my last. I loved knitting this so much I already
   have another one on the needles (I did stock up on yarn in Reykjavik ).
   The body is a pleasure to knit and doesnâ€™t take too long. And then you
   get to the challenging part. Figuring out the three colors at once in
   the yoke took me a minute. More info on modifications on Ravelry.

Cotton Candy Portuguese Merino

   July 2, 2018
   tags: fiar, Merino, Portuguese wool, spinning

   Took months, but I am very happy with this squishy 200 g â€“
   perfectly-balanced! â€“ mega Portuguese Merino skein in pastel pink hues.
   I feel I have made progress in my spinning technique and in making this
   wool shine at its best.

   Demorou meses, mas ficou Ã³ptima. Uma mega meada de Merino com 200 g,
   sem torÃ§Ã£o a mais nem a menos, e em tons pastel. Fico contente com os
   meus progressos tÃ©cnicos, mas sobretudo com o aproveitamento que tenho
   feito desta lÃ£ e das suas caracterÃ­sticas. Conhecer o material demora.

New Design: Maiami

   May 22, 2018
   tags: camisola, design, inspiraÃ§Ã£o, inspiration, knitting, mohair, new
   design, sweater, tricot

   Maiami is a Berlin-based knitwear company, run by designer Maike
   Dietrich and handmade in Germany and in other European locations. Their
   specialty are these puffy, fuzzy mohair sweaters. In bold colorblocks
   or soft pastels, the thing that I love most is how they make â€˜chunky
   knitâ€™ designs work . The mohair gives drape and wearability to
   oversized pieces in a way few yarns would. I am quite taken by the
   pleated yoke design and canâ€™t wait to try to do something like this
   myself.

   Maiami Ã© uma marca baseada em Berlin, criada pela designer Maike
   Dietrich. As peÃ§as de que mais gosto sÃ£o estas camisolas em mohair â€“ a
   especialidade da marca. Com tons suaves ou em blocos de cores garridas,
   sÃ£o sempre extremamente fofas. Combinam a forma ampla (o tal look
   â€™oversizedâ€™) com um fio extramamente maleÃ¡vel e fino em mohair. O
   resultado Ã©, nÃ£o sÃ³ uma peÃ§a visualmente interessante, mas uma camisola
   que realmente apetece vestir.

Churra BraganÃ§ana Rose Grey

   April 26, 2018
   tags: Churra, Churra BraganÃ§ana, Churra Galega, combing, fiar, LÃ£
   portuguesa, pentear, Portuguese wool, spinning

   Os meus velos favoritos sÃ£o provavelmente estes de Churra BraganÃ§ana
   que nem sÃ£o cinzentos, nem castanhos. Como me ensinaram no Tennessee,
   sÃ£o â€œrose greyâ€. Finalmente decidi comeÃ§ar a trabalhar com eles. Estas
   duas meadas sÃ£o de um saco de lÃ£ de segunda qualidade, penteada em
   Dezembro, que trouxe numa caixa, na mala, para os Estados Unidos. Uma
   maravilha para fiar, a lÃ£ penteada Ã© extremamente fofa e regular. No
   que toca a preparar Churra, nada chega a um bom par de pentes e a pouca
   torÃ§Ã£o na roda.

   My favorite wool fleeces are the rose grey colored Churra BraganÃ§anas
   that I have been hoarding over the years. I finally decided to start
   working on them. These two skeins are from a 2nd grade bag that I
   combed in Portugal in December. Packed the combed wool in a box and
   brought it with me to Michigan. It was a dream to spin, super soft and
   evenly layered. When it come to Churra, the magic formula for me is a
   good set of combs and just a little twist on the wheel.

Churra Lamb Yarn

   April 16, 2018
   tags: Churra BraganÃ§ana, combing, fiar, LÃ£ portuguesa, pentear,
   Portuguese wool, spinning

   Finally got around to spinning a box of combed churra from a couple of
   years ago. This was a lamb fleece, extra soft, but with some annoying
   staple length variation. The dark chocolate brown is hard to capture,
   but this is a really nice yarn â€“ softest churra to date. I spun it on
   my blue bonnet spinning wheel trying my best to give it just enough
   twist and no more. I like my churra yarns as relaxed as possible.
