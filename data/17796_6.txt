   Partant du constat que les donn√©es comportementales √©taient
   sous-exploit√©es, trois co-fondateurs se sont lanc√©s dans le
   d√©veloppement d‚Äôune plateforme technologique ax√©e sur des analyses
   s√©mantiques et statistiques permettant de transcrire les donn√©es de
   navigation d‚Äôinternautes pour les mettre √† disposition des annonceurs.
   Sirdata est cr√©√©e fin 2012 et poursuit depuis 5 ans le d√©veloppement
   continu de ses technologies conjugu√© √† une recherche constante de
   l‚Äôinnovation.

Sirdata personal data protection and privacy policy

   Latest version date: July 11th 2019.

   This Privacy Policy details the measures Sirdata undertakes and is
   committed to respect to ensure protection for the User‚Äôs Personal Data
   with regards to its core activities and for the purposes of audience
   research and analysis, optimisation and improvement of sites, products
   and services or for targeted and personalised marketing campaigns and
   fight against fraud.
   To access the privacy policy dedicated to the commercial and marketing
   management of Sirdata, please click here.

   By browsing this page, the User can access information on:
     * The way Sirdata collects Personal Data
     * The types of Personal Data collected
     * The use and purposes of the Data
     * The rights and methods of control available to the User
     * The security and confidentiality measures undertaken by Sirdata

   This personal data protection and privacy policy (hereinafter the
   ‚ÄúPolicy‚Ä) expresses our will and commitment to gaining the trust of the
   User. Therefore, we wish to draw their attention to two essential
   principles which Sirdata is committed to ensure protection for the Data
   it processes: transparency and control by the User of their Personal
   Data.
   PURPOSE OF POLICY

   This Policy is important for the User who wants a positive browsing
   experience they can trust. It is also important for us, since we aim to
   prove we demonstrate our transparency in the way we collect Data and
   protect the User‚Äôs confidentiality.

   We aim to answer the User‚Äôs questions accurately and appropriately, and
   meet their expectations by respecting their choices and rights. We
   invite all Users to take a moment to understand how we operate.

   In this objective, we make a lexicon of terms and a themes section
   available to the User at the end of the Policy.

   In the event of any divergence or inconsistency between the French
   version and any other language version of this policy or supporting
   document, the French version will prevail, be deemed authoritative and
   take precedence.
   HOW SIRDATA COLLECTS DATA

   Sirdata uses various technologies, including placing Cookies and other
   similar technologies, to collect and store non-nominative Personal Data
   only, when a User views the Site of one of our Sites Operators, or uses
   one of its services. Find out more

   When a User views the Site of one of our Sites Operators, or uses one
   of its services, we may use Cookies and other similar technologies to
   manage and store information about privacy notices they have received
   and their privacy choices. We do this pursuant to the policies and
   technical specifications of the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent
   Framework.
   TYPES OF PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED

   Sirdata collects exclusively non-nominative Personal Data. It means the
   Data collected by Sirdata does not enable a User to be identified
   directly (ie nominative data : the first name and the last name, the
   postal address or the phone number).

   Sirdata does not collect any Sensitive Data and no Data category or
   segment is created specifically for targeting minors.

   User‚Äôs Personal Data collected through the Sites of the Sites Operators
   by Sirdata are mainly browsing, interaction and some demographics Data:

   Data Type




   Examples



   Browsing and interaction
   Personal Data




   Number of accessed webpages, viewed products, researches done by the
   User



   Non-nominative demographic Personal Data




   The age range, the age or birth date of the User communicated by way of
   declaration via a form or when creating an account



   Through Sites Operators, Sirdata also collects:

   ‚Ä¢ The User‚Äôs hashed email address (forming a technical key associated
   with cookie. Find out more)

   ‚Ä¢ The User‚Äôs geographical information based on the IP address and
   connections (enabling the geographic location of the User on a country
   level but no more accurate than the city of connection or the district
   code. Find out more)

   The data collected through Sites Operators are pseudonymised, i.e.
   converted or manipulated via identifiers in the form
   c52c40bb75bc6b3209cffac354d81b7a or
   20171120_XXXX6b25e5164555f79bbb95865XXXX, which means that the User
   cannot be identified directly.
   USE AND PURPOSES OF THE DATA

   ‚Ä¢ By Sirdata
   Sirdata is a company that specialises in data marketing, whose
   activities consist primarily of :
     * Collecting and
     * Processing sociodemographic, browsing and interaction data.

   Using a small amount of apparently insignificant information, such as
   searching for a product or reading an article on the Site of a Site
   Operators, Sirdata :
     * Analyses, assesses and determines the areas of interest or probable
       intentions of the User.

   This enables Sirdata to
     * Segment the Users of the Sites Operators according to demographics,
       interest or intent criteria and to
     * Distribute this information through Audience Segments to its
       Customers and Partners, whose purposes are described
       hereunder. Find out more about Audience Segments

   Sirdata does not proceed to any direct marketing operation and does not
   exploit in its systems any nominative file on behalf of its Customers
   or Partners. Sirdata does not provide Users with any advertisement
   and/or marketing offers by email, mail or phone.

   ‚Ä¢ By Sirdata, our Customers, Partners and Partner‚Äôs customers

   Sirdata allows its Customers, Partners and Partners‚Äô customers
   to enrich their marketing experience and target Users with relevant
   offers that match their areas of interest.
   As a result, the data we collect then allows our Customers, Partners
   and Partners‚Äô customers to:
     * Provide consumers with adapted and personalised contents and/or
       offers
          + Using Audience Segments. Find out more about Audience Segments
          + Using audience‚Äôs pools based on modelling. Find out more about
            Modelled Audiences
     * Improve their consumer knowledge and relationship
     * Perform audience research and statistical analysis
     * Optimise and improve their products and services
     * Fight against fraud

   For example, when the User views and browses several Sites (such as the
   view of a specific product on a merchant website), their browsing and
   interaction data can be collected. The data will then be used by our
   Customers, Partners and Partners‚Äô customers so that next time the User
   browses, they will see content and advertisements that match their
   areas of interest as closely as possible (for example related to the
   viewed product).
   Find out more and consult other examples for data uses

   Find out more about our Partners

   In accordance with the applicable regulation, Sirdata‚Äôs lawful basis
   for processing Data is the User‚Äôs consent.

   User‚Äôs consent can be expressed and modified at any time using any
   methods offered to them to exercise their choices. Our Sites Operators
   are responsible for obtaining the informed consent of the User to save
   Cookies to their Device when they browse their Sites or use their
   services.
   RIGHTS AND METHODS OF CONTROL AVAILABLE TO USERS

   It is essential for Sirdata to enable the User to make informed choices
   and exercise their rights in full knowledge of the facts.

Right to object

   Sirdata does not collect nor proceed to any Users Personal Data
   treatment for its own ends without the User giving its consent prior to
   it through any mechanisms available on websites of Sites Operators.

   After this clarification, if the User no longer wishes any or all of
   their Data to be gathered and processed by Sirdata, they may exercise
   their right to object and deactivate the gathering of their Data by
   Sirdata.

   We wish to draw the User‚Äôs attention to the following elements:

   ‚Ä¢ Exercising the right to object will not prevent advertisement being
   displayed or promotional emails being received. Only advertisement
   and/or marketing operations using Sirdata‚Äôs personalisation services
   will cease.

   In other words, the User will no longer be shown offers that reflects
   their areas of interest through the use of Sirdata Cookies, but will
   continue to be shown advertisement and/or marketing offers whose
   content will no longer necessarily match their areas of interest, and
   may be dubious.

   ‚Ä¢ The exercising of the right to object proceeds through the placing of
   an objection cookie (Opt-Out Cookie), saved on the Internet Browser of
   the User. The exercising of the right to object must be operated on
   each Device and each Browser the User employs.

   ‚Ä¢ Deleting Cookies will remove the information needed to process the
   User‚Äôs objection.
   The same may apply when Browsers are changed or updated. If the Cookies
   are deleted or if the Browsers are changed/updated with deletion of
   Cookies, the User will therefore have to reconfirm their decision to
   exercise their right to object.

   ‚Ä¢ By objecting to the collect of their Data by Sirdata using Cookies,
   the User is informed that Sirdata‚Äôs Partners and Customers will no
   longer save Cookies on their Device by means of Sirdata.

   The latter will nevertheless be able to place Cookie without the use of
   Sirdata. The User can access more information related to personal data
   protection by Sirdata‚Äôs Partners by clicking hereunder.
   [BUTTON Input] (not
   implemented)____________________________________________________

   Users may also exercise their choices directly in their internet
   browser. The procedure for managing Cookies and Cookie preferences
   varies slightly between browsers. Users can view the steps for managing
   cookies in their browser‚Äôs help menu.

   ‚Ä¢ for Internet Explorer‚Ñ¢
   ‚Ä¢ for Safari‚Ñ¢
   ‚Ä¢ for Chrome‚Ñ¢
   ‚Ä¢ for Firefox‚Ñ¢
   ‚Ä¢ for Opera‚Ñ¢


Rights to access and erasure


   In accordance with the GDPR, we allow the User the right to access and
   erase their Data.

   Sirdata can fulfil the User's request for rectification subsequently to
   their exercice of their right to access.

   We wish to draw User‚Äôs attention to the fact that Sirdata processes
   exclusively non-nominative Personal Data. It means Sirdata does not
   process any nominative information on the User in its systems such as
   the first name, last name, postal address nor the email address.

   The gathering of Data by Sirdata relies indeed on the placing of Cookie
   in the User‚Äôs Devices.

   Therefore, in order to fulfill requests for access and erasure, we ask
   the User to provide us the relevant credentials listed below using the
   dedicated form.

   1) The Identifier of the Sirdata Cookie.

   ‚Ä¢ The Cookie isn‚Äôt associated with any first name, last name or email
   address but with an identifier in the form
   20171120_XXXX6b25e5164555f79bbb95865XXXXthat does not allow the User to
   be directly identified.
   ‚Ä¢ Without this technical information, we are unable to compare the Data
   we hold with a User who wishes to exercise a right of access or
   erasure.
   ‚Ä¢ The User can click here to find the identifier associated with the
   Internet Browser of the Device they are currently using.

   2) A statement on their honor that the User is the only one utilising
   the Device or has the exclusive control over the use of the Device
   whose Data may have been collected by Sirdata.

   ‚Ä¢ The Device (computer, smartphone, tablet or any connected media) can
   be of collective use (by the User, their partner, family, friends
   etc.). Therefore, the Data collected by Sirdata is not necessarily
   limited to the User‚Äôs.
   ‚Ä¢ If it is likely that said Device may have been used by a third party
   with the User‚Äôs agreement or without any objection, the latter must
   also undertake to obtain the agreement of said third parties in writing
   for us to satisfy the request, insofar as said request is likely to
   reveal information about the browsing history of said third parties.


   3) A valid identity credential.

   ‚Ä¢ Without identity credential, Sirdata can not ensure of the
   authenticity of the identity communicated by the User and can not
   satisfy the request.


   Why does the User need to provide Sirdata with all credentials?

   Sirdata ensures that User‚Äôs Personal Data is processed in strict
   confidence and implements the necessary measures to prevent
   unauthorised third parties from viewing, using, disclosing, modifying,
   damaging or destroying said Data.

   While Sirdata is not able to identify directly the User to satisfy
   their requests for access and erasure, and in accordance with the
   regulation, we ask the User to prove their identity and that they act
   within their own rights.

   As to illustrate our procedure, the User will find hereunder a
   practical example that could be encountered by Sirdata:

   Paul wishes to access the sites viewed by his 23 years old son James on
   the family computer. He completes and sends over a request to Sirdata
   using his son‚Äôs name James and indicates the identifier of the Cookie
   saved in the Browser of the family computer. His specific requirement
   is to be informed about all information related to any browsing
   behavior Sirdata would have gathered thanks to this Cookie.

   If Sirdata was to satisfy his request without verifying the identity
   and statement of honor, James‚Äô Personal Data would be disclosed to his
   father without his authorisation.
   SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY MEASURES

   Data Conservation

   All the Data collected are retained for a limited time, based on the
   purposes they were processed for and in accordance with the regulations
   in effect. Our Cookies are valid for a maximum of 365 days.

   The IP address is furthermore truncated on the fly when collected to
   retain what is necessary to deduce the User‚Äôs approximate location
   (country, city) at the time of connection.

   Sirdata then permanently deletes all Data in its database and storage
   servers.

   Data Transfer

   The Data we collect many be processed on servers located within or
   outside the European Union. In the event of a transfer of Data, we
   provide guarantees that we are compliant with European Union law and
   require and ensure that a high level of Data protection is implemented
   by our Subcontractors, Sites Operators, Partners or Customers around
   the world. Find out more

   Data Security

   We undertake to process the Data we collect in strict confidence.

   Sirdata places particular importance on the security of the User‚Äôs Data
   by using technologies that provide security in line with the most
   demanding standards, using SSL, hashing/encryption and firewall
   technologies. We do everything we can to ensure the confidentiality of
   the Data we collect and to prevent unauthorised third parties from
   viewing, using, disclosing, modifying, damaging or destroying said
   Data. Find out more

   Data Sharing and Disclosure

   Sirdata does not share the User‚Äôs Data with businesses, organisations
   non-Partner or non-Customer third parties unless we believe that there
   is a reasonable justification for accessing, using or disclosing said
   Data:

   ‚Ä¢ To our subsidiaries and service providers

   We may, in the context of our activities, transfer Data to our
   subsidiaries or Subcontractors that process the Data collected on our
   behalf, and in accordance with our instructions and this Policy. Under
   no circumstances may our Subcontractors appoint another Subcontractor
   without our prior authorisation in writing or use the Data for any
   purpose other than those described in this Policy.

   ‚Ä¢ In response to a request from an authorised public body

   In response to court summons or orders, judicial or administrative
   procedures or any other request issued by the competent authorities to
   which Sirdata must submit, or to establish or exercise its rights, or
   to defend itself against legal proceedings;
   To protect itself from any infringement of Sirdata‚Äôs or Users‚Äô rights,
   property or security pursuant to and in accordance with the law;
   To avoid, reveal or deal with fraudulent activities, security breaches
   or any technical problem that might affect Sirdata‚Äôs servers.
   OTHER INFORMATION

   This Policy may be subject to change. Any change to the rules of our
   Confidentiality Policy will be accessible as soon as it comes into
   effect on this page.

   Is there any further question about Sirdata‚Äôs Privacy Policy? For more
   detailed information about some practical terms or topics, we invite
   Users to take a look at the sections ‚ÄúLexicon‚Ä and ‚ÄúThemes‚Ä hereunder.

   Otherwise, please contact us using the following form and we will do
   our best to answer within a maximum of one month.
