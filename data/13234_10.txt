30 Top Websites & Blogs That Are Powered By WordPress

   WordPress is one of the most user-friendly content management systems,
   especially for the non-tech savvy. Iâ€™ve boasted on several occasions
   that you can create WordPress sites and handle a reasonably high amount
   of traffic. Apart from its remarkable user friendliness, you can use
   WordPress for a multitude of purposes.

   Now it is time to test that boast. Iâ€™m going to list a few of the
   worldâ€™s most visited websites which run on WordPress.

   Please note, some of these websites may not rank as highly as you might
   expect on Alexa. If that is the case for any particular website here,
   it happens to cover a niche that isnâ€™t as popular or there arenâ€™t any
   better WordPress websites in the particular niche.

   The reasoning or the motivation behind this post is to not only
   demonstrate the power of WordPress in terms of ability to create
   high/medium traffic sites, but also to demonstrate WordPressâ€™s
   usability across a wide spectrum of possible purposes and to show how
   organizations, corporations, small businesses, non profits, pop stars
   and athletes use WordPress for their on-line platforms.

   In no particular order, here are some awesome websites which run on
   WordPress.

Quartz

   quartz-infinite-scroll-wordpress-blog
   quartz-infinite-scroll-wordpress-blog

   An awesome news outlet born in 2012 to deliver business news across the
   world and cover every aspect of the new global economy. This website
   was created and designed to meet the needs of the modern web, where
   people reading the news are constantly on the move. Thus, it naturally
   looks great on tablets and mobile phones.

   Quartz is an excellent source of credible information with a great
   emphasis on digital storytelling as opposed to how traditional news
   sources operate. The website itself was designed so as to bring the
   benefits of the web and deliver it with the elegance of an application.

   The website is minimal, as are the menus; there is little to no
   distraction and the website enhances readability. A single full-screen
   image dominates individual posts. These posts provide an initial
   perspective and a glimpse into the topic of the post. But what follows
   after it is great content with well chosen typography and few images.

   The website also seems to operate on an infinite scroll, which is great
   for reading continually. It reduces the burden on menus for navigation
   of the site.

The New Yorker

   the-new-yorker-website the-new-yorker-website

   A weekly magazine which provides a melange of news on international
   affairs, popular culture, arts, business, science, technology and
   politics. And to top it off, they also report on poetry, humor and
   cartoons. Again, the theme here seems to be the same; the website can
   easily be viewed on mobile devices. The magazine is available for
   mobile readers via an app, which can be found in the App Store, on
   Amazon, and Google Play.

   A traditional magazine relies on subscriptions for revenue, as does The
   New Yorker. They have digital, print and a combination plan, which
   helps them generate revenue. The digital plan is a lot better option
   than the print edition. That is because youâ€™ll have access to their
   complete digital archives which goes all the way back to 1925.
   Subscribers can access content based on their membership. Basically,
   you can login to access premium content from anywhere in the world.

   The websiteâ€™s menu is a whole lot larger than Quartz, as you might
   imagine given the breadth of topics that it covers. The website is
   dotted with imagery of all sizes, and yet there is a lot of white space
   on the site. The publishing mechanism that WordPress provides makes it
   possible for creative writers and artists to publish content via normal
   written content, podcasts, videos, slideshows and interactive graphics
   easily.

BBC America

   bbc-america-wordpress-site bbc-america-wordpress-site

   BBC America brings the best of entertainment, including natural
   history, movies, sci-fi and drama. Ever heard of Doctor Who,
   Broadchurch, Man versus Wild or Orphan Black? Well, BBC America brought
   to you those shows.

   A lot of the content on the website is primarily about TV shows of
   different genres. In addition, great depth provides scheduling
   information; thereâ€™s a lot of video content in the form of teasers, and
   plenty of blog content about the TV shows and the entertainment
   business.

   There is also a shopping tab among the menu options. It permits the
   purchase of TV series like Top Gear and Sherlock. Although, I must
   point out that this leads to a BBC sister site, which does not run on
   WordPress.

   In all likelihood, the followers of TV series use the website more as
   reference to keep track of the timings of their favorite shows and
   their release dates. And the websiteâ€™s scheduling information structure
   might support that claim; it is well built and intuitive to handle. In
   fact, the schedule page of BBC America seems to be running on Thematic,
   which is a free WordPress theme.

   This website is genuinely multifaceted, and delivers a multitude of
   content types. A lot of the content also seems to link back to the
   mother site of BBC, which creates a traffic loop. There is a menu atop
   the website with a wide spectrum of topics, which links back to BBCâ€™s
   primary news website.

Time Inc.

   timeinc-website timeinc-website

   Time Inc., one of the most well known brands in the world. Let me put
   this into perspective: nearly 50% of the population of the United
   States will engage with a Time Inc. brand in a month. And they run
   their website on WordPress. Although, some of their brands may have
   other content management systems working in tandem with WordPress, or
   may run on a non-WordPress platform.

   That being said, it should take anything away from the fact that
   WordPress is incredibly versatile and can be used by a corporation that
   controls such a sizable portion of the media we consume. The website is
   largely descriptive of the Time brand and the brands they have in their
   diverse portfolio.

   Youâ€™ll find on the site what you might expect from any reasonably sized
   company. There is a great deal of information about their leadership,
   company profile, history, corporate social responsibility, investment
   information and career opportunities. They even report their quarterly
   earnings in the first page, as you might expect from any corporation
   whose primary motive is to make money for the shareholders.

   But in comparison to most corporate websites, this one is not in the
   least bit dry or boring. As you can see above, the imagery is excellent
   and greatly distracts us from the fact that it is a website of a pretty
   big corporate entity.

Time.com

   time-news-magazine-website time-news-magazine-website

   A brand owned by Time Inc.,Time magazine is one of the most widely
   recognized and read magazines in the world. A readership of around 25
   million strong and as of 2012, the eleventh most circulated magazine in
   the United States.

   The website is what you might expect from a news outlet, the site
   design is based on a side menu. The website uses a lot of red
   especially in the navigation options and unlike previous websites,
   there is little empty white space. The emphasis is far more on
   delivering news content as quickly as possible, there are also articles
   with great insightful depth in the magazine. Although, when you compare
   the website to Quartz, there is definitely less of an emphasis on
   readability.

   They publish on pretty much every topic you can imagine and the landing
   page has a lot of content on it. Images the site uses, some large and
   some thumbnails accompany the various articles on the site.

   As you can imagine such a website probably has a great number of
   authors and full time staff. It must certainly help to have WordPress,
   when publishing so much content produced by a number of authors and
   then checked by multiple editors. They also work on a subscription
   model for premium content.

TechCrunch

   techcrunch-tech-news-wordpress-blog techcrunch-tech-news-wordpress-blog

   TechCrunch covers breaking news about the technology sector; they write
   about startups and a plethora of Internet products. Micheal Arrington
   starts this website to share information about new companies that were
   changing technology.

   The website menu is relatively simple, and the content itself, which is
   largely text, some images & video, is presented in a grid-like format
   working in tandem with a timeline system. Said grid displays posts
   according to publish time. Since the emphasis lies in creating content
   about breakthroughs before anyone else, the timeline format is ideal
   for presenting content.

   Thereâ€™s also a purely video-based section on the site, which is
   dedicated to delivering new tech, interviews with tech industry experts
   & innovators and product reviews. TechCrunch is also well-known for its
   startup battlefield, which is dedicated to information on startups and
   their funding.

IFC

   ifc-entertainment-site ifc-entertainment-site

   IFC is a website dedicated to the entertainment industry with a focus
   on drama and comedy. It holds a lot of scheduling information which are
   easily accessible for visitors. The site also hosts information on
   movies, two blogs and some video content. IFC is unlike most websites
   where more white space is preferred; the siteâ€™s background is black,
   and the typography is bold and black, against a light blue background.

007

   007-james-bond-wordpress-site 007-james-bond-wordpress-site

   One of the most stylish, suave characters to have ever existed, James
   Bond is not just a spy; the character has been a lot more, and
   represents a regal elegance which you might only associate with the
   choicest of brands. So creating a website for the famous 007 character
   requires an equal amount of sophistication in design.

   The siteâ€™s design is, as you might expect, regal, to say the least.
   There are three colors involved here: oneâ€™s the siteâ€™s background, the
   textâ€™s background, and the text itself. There is a lot of white space,
   while the white text is placed against a black background.

   The website is modeled on a portfolio or grid with the images making up
   for what some might consider a lack of color, given the abundance of
   black and white. But the use of only black and white primarily is
   probably what makes this site look great.

   If one were ever concerned whether a WordPress website can be designed
   for luxury brands, then this website is a great example of how awesome
   a WordPress site can be when it falls on the hands of the right
   developer.

Thrive Magazine

   thrive-dark-themed-website thrive-dark-themed-website

   A magazine that reports on sports, fitness, entrepreneurship and
   nutrition. Thrive employs a dark background set against big, white
   text, and a simple primary menu to navigate the website. The site does
   not particularly rank highly, but it does boast a very simple and
   straightforward design.

   Iâ€™ve seen many websites use minimal designs with white backgrounds.
   Hereâ€™s a rather minimal website that uses a dark background. Besides, a
   website that covers fitness is a good addition to this collection.

Van Heusen

   vanheusen-fashion-website vanheusen-fashion-website

   Yet another brand that is associated with style and regal
   professionalism, very similar to the 007 brand. The website contains a
   ton of information on their various products, loads of images of their
   catalog, and a few videos advertising the inventiveness of their
   clothing line.

The Next Web

   thenextweb-wordpress-tech-blog thenextweb-wordpress-tech-blog

   If you are like me, youâ€™ve probably followed The Next Web religiously.
   The site covers pretty much anything that comes out of the Internet and
   technology. There is a lot of content about how technology interacts
   with the world as we know it. They discuss money, insights into the
   tech world, and a whole lot of other cool stuff.

   The website is what you might expect from a typical tech website: a lot
   of images with the articles displayed in a grid. The primary menu is
   sticky and always stays on the screen. This is a nice touch for a
   website that generates an enormous amount of content on a daily basis.

Fortune Magazine

   fortune-business-news-magazine fortune-business-news-magazine

   Fortune is yet another well-known magazine from Time, Inc. The website
   is rather crowded with content, and there is lot less space for each
   single article or post on the homepage. This is normal on websites
   where the rate of content generation is very high and there are a great
   number of news stories worth reporting on in a small duration of time.

   A very purposeful website created to bring breaking news and insightful
   articles from the world of business.

ProBlogger

   problogger-website problogger-website

   One of my favorite websites, an absolutely great read for any freelance
   writer or Internet marketer. The website has a blog, podcast content,
   ebooks and an incredibly popular job board.

   You may not think much of the siteâ€™s design, but youâ€™ll be amazed at
   how successful the website has been when it comes to connecting with
   audiences and attracting the right type of visitors. This is a fairly
   straightforward approach when creating what is essentially a blog that
   offers professional advice, tutorials and tips. The simplicity probably
   has a great deal to do with their success.

StartUp Weekend

   startup-weekend-by-google startup-weekend-by-google

   A well-designed website as you might expect, the menu is rather quirky
   in the form of cloud bubbles. The website is a little more than a
   landing page with some extra content regarding the event details of
   startup meets. But as far as its function which revolves around event
   management is concerned, the website is more than adequate and performs
   the job quite well.

Smithsonian National Museum Of African Art

   africa-educ-musem-wordpress-site africa-educ-musem-wordpress-site

   You can find all sorts of content on this website, including a ton of
   amazing images and information about events and educational programs.
   While the website might not fall into the category of being a corporate
   website, it certainly has a regal definition tempered by flair and
   style that you might find in a website that covers popular social
   culture.

   I certainly wouldnâ€™t have imagined a website for a museum using
   WordPress. So, I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon the
   existence of this particular website.

Beyonce

   beyonce-wordpress-site beyonce-wordpress-site

   Yet another social and cultural icon of our times, a website completely
   dedicated to the artist Beyonce. The website has a lot of work from her
   photography catalogs. Furthermore, big bold large images cover the
   landing page of the site. Also, the side menu is rather large when
   invoked. Overall, it is a pretty awesome site for a great artist.

Usain Bolt

   usain-bolt-wordpress-website usain-bolt-wordpress-website

   If you were ever asked to pick an athlete whose performance is beyond
   comparison in his or her field, Bolt would certainly be among the
   contenders. The Jamaican sprinterâ€™s website is dedicated to his
   athletic achievements and contains a lot of images. It boasts a full
   screen slider followed by a news stream, reporting his most recent
   sporting feats and his other adventures.

Invisible Children

   invisiblepeople-charity-wordpress-website
   invisiblepeople-charity-wordpress-website

   Invisible Children is a great website albeit about a sad topic. The
   website is the front for an NGO that fights for the rights of children
   who have been entrenched in the LRA and abducted for the purpose of
   serving as child soldiers.

   The website itself is brilliant in terms of its user interface and has
   the right functionality to help combat and save as many children as
   possible.

AMC

   amc-movie-wordpress-site amc-movie-wordpress-site

   The website for AMC, the makers of â€œThe Walking Deadâ€ and many other
   incredibly popular shows. AMC has a lot of powerful, full screen
   imagery intended to capture the curiosity and attention of prospective
   audiences to their TV shows. They also have a schedule information
   section, a blog and a shopping section.

Google Ventures

   google-ventures-wordpress-website google-ventures-wordpress-website

   Minimalism at its best. The menu structure and icons it employ for
   navigation are great; there is very little in the way of distraction on
   their pages. Google Ventures primarily tells the story of how theyâ€™ve
   helped startups grow and scale. Their website also provides extensive
   information on the startups theyâ€™ve funded.

The Rolling Stones

   rollingstones-band-website rollingstones-band-website

   One of the most well-known bands and/or brands in the music industry
   for more than half century, their website uses WordPress. The website
   has a lot of pink against a blue background and lots of videos, given
   the nature of the content you might expect. That is true at least on
   the landing page. But, if you explore the website a bit more, youâ€™ll
   also find a lot of text content equally and well presented.

Outbrain

   outbrain-business-website outbrain-business-website

   A professional content discovery service that makes more than 200
   billion recommendations on a daily basis. The well-desinged website has
   a few full-screen images and uses the color orange very effectively
   indeed. There is very little text on the homepage and a menu that is as
   small as can be. The site is also incredibly easy to navigate.

Wired

   wired-business-news-website wired-business-news-website

   Wired is a magazine that brings you tomorrowâ€™s technologies today.
   Their main website has a lot of content and a pretty large menu with a
   ton of options to choose from. It also uses a partial grid system in
   conjunction with side bars displaying a content stream of new
   information, as new ones are generated on the website.

   Weâ€™ve seen so many websites ranging from corporations, small online
   businesses to non profit organizations and magazines leveraging
   WordPress as a means to publish content on the Internet. But WordPress
   is also used as a blog, and it is an awesome platform for your average
   blog.

   But hold on, it isnâ€™t just the average blog that uses WordPress. There
   are a great number of websites that use WordPress to run their blogs.
   Letâ€™s have a look at a few of the best!

Sony

   sony-official-news-blog sony-official-news-blog

   A very large corporate brand in the electronics and gaming industry
   renown for its gaming consoles and smart phones. Their official blog
   runs on the WordPress platform; there is not much in the way of style
   in the website. The site has been designed to add a lot of text content
   about their products and various product specifications. There is a
   humongous archive with a lot of information on their various products
   stretching back to 2007.

Play Station Blog

   playstation-games-news-site playstation-games-news-site

   The website is pretty awesome with a portfolio/grid approach to video
   and image rich content. Theyâ€™ve packed in a lot of images into a very
   small space at the top of the site. Moreover, as you scroll down, the
   site is divided into two columns, with large video content bearing
   individual posts.

TED Blog

   ted-simple-wordpress-blog ted-simple-wordpress-blog

   TED is another non-profit organization that leverages the power of
   WordPress to communicate ideas via the web. The website employs a menu
   with not too many options, followed by a full-screen article post and a
   two-column grid with more recently published articles. They also have
   quite an extensive footer. It directs you to the various TED programs
   and communication channels for interacting with TED.

Rackspace

   rackspace-cloud-platform-website rackspace-cloud-platform-website

   Rackspace is a WordPress blog, and is one of the leadings provider of
   raw computing infrastructure. A simple blog with with the posts divided
   into featured and latest posts. Obviously, as the blog of a service
   provider, there are a lot of link-backs to their services and their
   mother site.

Official LinkedIn Blog

   linkedin-corporate-wordpress-blog linkedin-corporate-wordpress-blog

   Yes, the most used professional social networkâ€™s blog runs on
   WordPress. The website is designed for one purpose, and that is made
   abundantly clear from the onset. Most of the content on the blog
   focuses on human resources, talent management and hiring practices
   across the globe.

SAP News Center

   sap-news-center sap-news-center

   SAP is a multinational corporation that creates software for enterprise
   resource planning among others. Their blog delivers news from their
   various undertakings from all their divisions in different countries.

Facebook Newsroom

   facebook-newsroom-wordpress-theme facebook-newsroom-wordpress-theme

   The worldâ€™s most popular social networkâ€™s official blog runs on
   WordPress. The site is minimal and has one large image/video on a
   slider system . It is then followed by simple plain text news with no
   thumbnails. Fairly simple site but remarkably readable as you might
   expect.

Final Thoughts

   I hope Iâ€™ve amply demonstrated how WordPress can be used and how wide a
   spectrum of purposes/businesses/niches WordPress can handle. It is very
   unlikely that the site you want to create can not be best achieved with
   WordPress as the Content Management System.

   waiting for â€“ you have a wealth of knowledge available here on Colorlib

       Hi Thanks for your tips.
       I agree that if you want to increase traffic to your site or wish
       the targeted audience grew, there are plenty of steps that you, a
       blogger, can follow in order to improve your website traffic and
       audience.
       The first step would be to write a blog every day. (Make it a
       habit!)
       Then, you could use a website tracking tool such as Google
       Analytics to monitor activity on your blog â€“ web visitors, clicks,
       and conversions, etc.
       Next, you could use social media to drive traffic to your site.
       Fourth, include effective call to action to increase repeat
       visitors.
       Lastly, if you know the basics of on-page SEO and off-page SEO as
       well, then you should see significant number of traffic to your
       site!

       Really Great list and I find useful information about how WordPress
       helps to build the big brands on the internet. Before reading this
       article Iâ€™m not aware of using WordPress CMS for big enterprises.
       But now I will recommend to my big enterprise clients.

            Rachel,
            WordPress is not longer used just to create a simple WordPress
            blogs. It is used by millions of websites and many of theme
            are highly trafficked ones.

       I didnâ€™t expect some of the sites on this list to be running
       WordPress lol. Especially AMC, LinkedIn and Playstation to name a
       few! Shows you just how powerful WordPress is at the present. I
       actually use WordPress for my personal blogs, I used Blogger a
       while back but switched to WordPress since it was a lot easier to
       use.

            Chani,
            They are using a WordPress just like we are and we arenâ€™t
            paying for it nor receiving any money that we use it. So I see
            no reason why The Rolling Stones should be treated
            differently.

             30 Top Websites & Blogs That Are Powered By WordPress

   Vishnu

   4 months ago

   WordPress is one of the most user-friendly content management systems,
   especially for the non-tech savvy. Iâ€™ve boasted on several occasions
   that you can create WordPress sites and handle a reasonably high amount
   of traffic. Apart from its remarkable user friendliness, you can use
   WordPress for a multitude of purposes.

   Now it is time to test that boast. Iâ€™m going to list a few of the
   worldâ€™s most visited websites which run on WordPress.

   Please note, some of these websites may not rank as highly as you might
   expect on Alexa. If that is the case for any particular website here,
   it happens to cover a niche that isnâ€™t as popular or there arenâ€™t any
   better WordPress websites in the particular niche.

   The reasoning or the motivation behind this post is to not only
   demonstrate the power of WordPress in terms of ability to create
   high/medium traffic sites, but also to demonstrate WordPressâ€™s
   usability across a wide spectrum of possible purposes and to show how
   organizations, corporations, small businesses, non profits, pop stars
   and athletes use WordPress for their on-line platforms.

   In no particular order, here are some awesome websites which run on
   WordPress.

Quartz

   quartz-infinite-scroll-wordpress-blog

   An awesome news outlet born in 2012 to deliver business news across the
   world and cover every aspect of the new global economy. This website
   was created and designed to meet the needs of the modern web, where
   people reading the news are constantly on the move. Thus, it naturally
   looks great on tablets and mobile phones.

   Quartz is an excellent source of credible information with a great
   emphasis on digital storytelling as opposed to how traditional news
   sources operate. The website itself was designed so as to bring the
   benefits of the web and deliver it with the elegance of an application.

   The website is minimal, as are the menus; there is little to no
   distraction and the website enhances readability. A single full-screen
   image dominates individual posts. These posts provide an initial
   perspective and a glimpse into the topic of the post. But what follows
   after it is great content with well chosen typography and few images.

   The website also seems to operate on an infinite scroll, which is great
   for reading continually. It reduces the burden on menus for navigation
   of the site.

The New Yorker

   the-new-yorker-website

   A weekly magazine which provides a melange of news on international
   affairs, popular culture, arts, business, science, technology and
   politics. And to top it off, they also report on poetry, humor and
   cartoons. Again, the theme here seems to be the same; the website can
   easily be viewed on mobile devices. The magazine is available for
   mobile readers via an app, which can be found in the App Store, on
   Amazon, and Google Play.

   A traditional magazine relies on subscriptions for revenue, as does The
   New Yorker. They have digital, print and a combination plan, which
   helps them generate revenue. The digital plan is a lot better option
   than the print edition. That is because youâ€™ll have access to their
   complete digital archives which goes all the way back to 1925.
   Subscribers can access content based on their membership. Basically,
   you can login to access premium content from anywhere in the world.

   The websiteâ€™s menu is a whole lot larger than Quartz, as you might
   imagine given the breadth of topics that it covers. The website is
   dotted with imagery of all sizes, and yet there is a lot of white space
   on the site. The publishing mechanism that WordPress provides makes it
   possible for creative writers and artists to publish content via normal
   written content, podcasts, videos, slideshows and interactive graphics
   easily.

BBC America

   bbc-america-wordpress-site

   BBC America brings the best of entertainment, including natural
   history, movies, sci-fi and drama. Ever heard of Doctor Who,
   Broadchurch, Man versus Wild or Orphan Black? Well, BBC America brought
   to you those shows.

   A lot of the content on the website is primarily about TV shows of
   different genres. In addition, great depth provides scheduling
   information; thereâ€™s a lot of video content in the form of teasers, and
   plenty of blog content about the TV shows and the entertainment
   business.

   There is also a shopping tab among the menu options. It permits the
   purchase of TV series like Top Gear and Sherlock. Although, I must
   point out that this leads to a BBC sister site, which does not run on
   WordPress.

   In all likelihood, the followers of TV series use the website more as
   reference to keep track of the timings of their favorite shows and
   their release dates. And the websiteâ€™s scheduling information structure
   might support that claim; it is well built and intuitive to handle. In
   fact, the schedule page of BBC America seems to be running on Thematic,
   which is a free WordPress theme.

   This website is genuinely multifaceted, and delivers a multitude of
   content types. A lot of the content also seems to link back to the
   mother site of BBC, which creates a traffic loop. There is a menu atop
   the website with a wide spectrum of topics, which links back to BBCâ€™s
   primary news website.

Time Inc.

   timeinc-website

   Time Inc., one of the most well known brands in the world. Let me put
   this into perspective: nearly 50% of the population of the United
   States will engage with a Time Inc. brand in a month. And they run
   their website on WordPress. Although, some of their brands may have
   other content management systems working in tandem with WordPress, or
   may run on a non-WordPress platform.

   That being said, it should take anything away from the fact that
   WordPress is incredibly versatile and can be used by a corporation that
   controls such a sizable portion of the media we consume. The website is
   largely descriptive of the Time brand and the brands they have in their
   diverse portfolio.

   Youâ€™ll find on the site what you might expect from any reasonably sized
   company. There is a great deal of information about their leadership,
   company profile, history, corporate social responsibility, investment
   information and career opportunities. They even report their quarterly
   earnings in the first page, as you might expect from any corporation
   whose primary motive is to make money for the shareholders.

   But in comparison to most corporate websites, this one is not in the
   least bit dry or boring. As you can see above, the imagery is excellent
   and greatly distracts us from the fact that it is a website of a pretty
   big corporate entity.

Time.com

   time-news-magazine-website

   A brand owned by Time Inc.,Time magazine is one of the most widely
   recognized and read magazines in the world. A readership of around 25
   million strong and as of 2012, the eleventh most circulated magazine in
   the United States.

   The website is what you might expect from a news outlet, the site
   design is based on a side menu. The website uses a lot of red
   especially in the navigation options and unlike previous websites,
   there is little empty white space. The emphasis is far more on
   delivering news content as quickly as possible, there are also articles
   with great insightful depth in the magazine. Although, when you compare
   the website to Quartz, there is definitely less of an emphasis on
   readability.

   They publish on pretty much every topic you can imagine and the landing
   page has a lot of content on it. Images the site uses, some large and
   some thumbnails accompany the various articles on the site.

   As you can imagine such a website probably has a great number of
   authors and full time staff. It must certainly help to have WordPress,
   when publishing so much content produced by a number of authors and
   then checked by multiple editors. They also work on a subscription
   model for premium content.

TechCrunch

   techcrunch-tech-news-wordpress-blog

   TechCrunch covers breaking news about the technology sector; they write
   about startups and a plethora of Internet products. Micheal Arrington
   starts this website to share information about new companies that were
   changing technology.

   The website menu is relatively simple, and the content itself, which is
   largely text, some images & video, is presented in a grid-like format
   working in tandem with a timeline system. Said grid displays posts
   according to publish time. Since the emphasis lies in creating content
   about breakthroughs before anyone else, the timeline format is ideal
   for presenting content.

   Thereâ€™s also a purely video-based section on the site, which is
   dedicated to delivering new tech, interviews with tech industry experts
   & innovators and product reviews. TechCrunch is also well-known for its
   startup battlefield, which is dedicated to information on startups and
   their funding.

IFC

   ifc-entertainment-site

   IFC is a website dedicated to the entertainment industry with a focus
   on drama and comedy. It holds a lot of scheduling information which are
   easily accessible for visitors. The site also hosts information on
   movies, two blogs and some video content. IFC is unlike most websites
   where more white space is preferred; the siteâ€™s background is black,
   and the typography is bold and black, against a light blue background.

007

   007-james-bond-wordpress-site

   One of the most stylish, suave characters to have ever existed, James
   Bond is not just a spy; the character has been a lot more, and
   represents a regal elegance which you might only associate with the
   choicest of brands. So creating a website for the famous 007 character
   requires an equal amount of sophistication in design.

   The siteâ€™s design is, as you might expect, regal, to say the least.
   There are three colors involved here: oneâ€™s the siteâ€™s background, the
   textâ€™s background, and the text itself. There is a lot of white space,
   while the white text is placed against a black background.

   The website is modeled on a portfolio or grid with the images making up
   for what some might consider a lack of color, given the abundance of
   black and white. But the use of only black and white primarily is
   probably what makes this site look great.

   If one were ever concerned whether a WordPress website can be designed
   for luxury brands, then this website is a great example of how awesome
   a WordPress site can be when it falls on the hands of the right
   developer.

Thrive Magazine

   thrive-dark-themed-website

   A magazine that reports on sports, fitness, entrepreneurship and
   nutrition. Thrive employs a dark background set against big, white
   text, and a simple primary menu to navigate the website. The site does
   not particularly rank highly, but it does boast a very simple and
   straightforward design.

   Iâ€™ve seen many websites use minimal designs with white backgrounds.
   Hereâ€™s a rather minimal website that uses a dark background. Besides, a
   website that covers fitness is a good addition to this collection.

Van Heusen

   vanheusen-fashion-website

   Yet another brand that is associated with style and regal
   professionalism, very similar to the 007 brand. The website contains a
   ton of information on their various products, loads of images of their
   catalog, and a few videos advertising the inventiveness of their
   clothing line.

The Next Web

   thenextweb-wordpress-tech-blog

   If you are like me, youâ€™ve probably followed The Next Web religiously.
   The site covers pretty much anything that comes out of the Internet and
   technology. There is a lot of content about how technology interacts
   with the world as we know it. They discuss money, insights into the
   tech world, and a whole lot of other cool stuff.

   The website is what you might expect from a typical tech website: a lot
   of images with the articles displayed in a grid. The primary menu is
   sticky and always stays on the screen. This is a nice touch for a
   website that generates an enormous amount of content on a daily basis.

Fortune Magazine

   fortune-business-news-magazine

   Fortune is yet another well-known magazine from Time, Inc. The website
   is rather crowded with content, and there is lot less space for each
   single article or post on the homepage. This is normal on websites
   where the rate of content generation is very high and there are a great
   number of news stories worth reporting on in a small duration of time.

   A very purposeful website created to bring breaking news and insightful
   articles from the world of business.

ProBlogger

   problogger-website

   One of my favorite websites, an absolutely great read for any freelance
   writer or Internet marketer. The website has a blog, podcast content,
   ebooks and an incredibly popular job board.

   You may not think much of the siteâ€™s design, but youâ€™ll be amazed at
   how successful the website has been when it comes to connecting with
   audiences and attracting the right type of visitors. This is a fairly
   straightforward approach when creating what is essentially a blog that
   offers professional advice, tutorials and tips. The simplicity probably
   has a great deal to do with their success.

StartUp Weekend

   startup-weekend-by-google

   A well-designed website as you might expect, the menu is rather quirky
   in the form of cloud bubbles. The website is a little more than a
   landing page with some extra content regarding the event details of
   startup meets. But as far as its function which revolves around event
   management is concerned, the website is more than adequate and performs
   the job quite well.

Smithsonian National Museum Of African Art

   africa-educ-musem-wordpress-site

   You can find all sorts of content on this website, including a ton of
   amazing images and information about events and educational programs.
   While the website might not fall into the category of being a corporate
   website, it certainly has a regal definition tempered by flair and
   style that you might find in a website that covers popular social
   culture.

   I certainly wouldnâ€™t have imagined a website for a museum using
   WordPress. So, I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon the
   existence of this particular website.

Beyonce

   beyonce-wordpress-site

   Yet another social and cultural icon of our times, a website completely
   dedicated to the artist Beyonce. The website has a lot of work from her
   photography catalogs. Furthermore, big bold large images cover the
   landing page of the site. Also, the side menu is rather large when
   invoked. Overall, it is a pretty awesome site for a great artist.

Usain Bolt

   usain-bolt-wordpress-website

   If you were ever asked to pick an athlete whose performance is beyond
   comparison in his or her field, Bolt would certainly be among the
   contenders. The Jamaican sprinterâ€™s website is dedicated to his
   athletic achievements and contains a lot of images. It boasts a full
   screen slider followed by a news stream, reporting his most recent
   sporting feats and his other adventures.

Invisible Children

   invisiblepeople-charity-wordpress-website

   Invisible Children is a great website albeit about a sad topic. The
   website is the front for an NGO that fights for the rights of children
   who have been entrenched in the LRA and abducted for the purpose of
   serving as child soldiers.

   The website itself is brilliant in terms of its user interface and has
   the right functionality to help combat and save as many children as
   possible.

AMC

   amc-movie-wordpress-site

   The website for AMC, the makers of â€œThe Walking Deadâ€ and many other
   incredibly popular shows. AMC has a lot of powerful, full screen
   imagery intended to capture the curiosity and attention of prospective
   audiences to their TV shows. They also have a schedule information
   section, a blog and a shopping section.

Google Ventures

   google-ventures-wordpress-website

   Minimalism at its best. The menu structure and icons it employ for
   navigation are great; there is very little in the way of distraction on
   their pages. Google Ventures primarily tells the story of how theyâ€™ve
   helped startups grow and scale. Their website also provides extensive
   information on the startups theyâ€™ve funded.

The Rolling Stones

   rollingstones-band-website

   One of the most well-known bands and/or brands in the music industry
   for more than half century, their website uses WordPress. The website
   has a lot of pink against a blue background and lots of videos, given
   the nature of the content you might expect. That is true at least on
   the landing page. But, if you explore the website a bit more, youâ€™ll
   also find a lot of text content equally and well presented.

Outbrain

   outbrain-business-website

   A professional content discovery service that makes more than 200
   billion recommendations on a daily basis. The well-desinged website has
   a few full-screen images and uses the color orange very effectively
   indeed. There is very little text on the homepage and a menu that is as
   small as can be. The site is also incredibly easy to navigate.

Wired

   wired-business-news-website

   Wired is a magazine that brings you tomorrowâ€™s technologies today.
   Their main website has a lot of content and a pretty large menu with a
   ton of options to choose from. It also uses a partial grid system in
   conjunction with side bars displaying a content stream of new
   information, as new ones are generated on the website.

   Weâ€™ve seen so many websites ranging from corporations, small online
   businesses to non profit organizations and magazines leveraging
   WordPress as a means to publish content on the Internet. But WordPress
   is also used as a blog, and it is an awesome platform for your average
   blog.

   But hold on, it isnâ€™t just the average blog that uses WordPress. There
   are a great number of websites that use WordPress to run their blogs.
   Letâ€™s have a look at a few of the best!

Sony

   sony-official-news-blog

   A very large corporate brand in the electronics and gaming industry
   renown for its gaming consoles and smart phones. Their official blog
   runs on the WordPress platform; there is not much in the way of style
   in the website. The site has been designed to add a lot of text content
   about their products and various product specifications. There is a
   humongous archive with a lot of information on their various products
   stretching back to 2007.

Play Station Blog

   playstation-games-news-site

   The website is pretty awesome with a portfolio/grid approach to video
   and image rich content. Theyâ€™ve packed in a lot of images into a very
   small space at the top of the site. Moreover, as you scroll down, the
   site is divided into two columns, with large video content bearing
   individual posts.

TED Blog

   ted-simple-wordpress-blog

   TED is another non-profit organization that leverages the power of
   WordPress to communicate ideas via the web. The website employs a menu
   with not too many options, followed by a full-screen article post and a
   two-column grid with more recently published articles. They also have
   quite an extensive footer. It directs you to the various TED programs
   and communication channels for interacting with TED.

Rackspace

   rackspace-cloud-platform-website

   Rackspace is a WordPress blog, and is one of the leadings provider of
   raw computing infrastructure. A simple blog with with the posts divided
   into featured and latest posts. Obviously, as the blog of a service
   provider, there are a lot of link-backs to their services and their
   mother site.

Official LinkedIn Blog

   linkedin-corporate-wordpress-blog

   Yes, the most used professional social networkâ€™s blog runs on
   WordPress. The website is designed for one purpose, and that is made
   abundantly clear from the onset. Most of the content on the blog
   focuses on human resources, talent management and hiring practices
   across the globe.

SAP News Center

   sap-news-center

   SAP is a multinational corporation that creates software for enterprise
   resource planning among others. Their blog delivers news from their
   various undertakings from all their divisions in different countries.

Facebook Newsroom

   facebook-newsroom-wordpress-theme

   The worldâ€™s most popular social networkâ€™s official blog runs on
   WordPress. The site is minimal and has one large image/video on a
   slider system . It is then followed by simple plain text news with no
   thumbnails. Fairly simple site but remarkably readable as you might
   expect.

Final Thoughts

   I hope Iâ€™ve amply demonstrated how WordPress can be used and how wide a
   spectrum of purposes/businesses/niches WordPress can handle. It is very
   unlikely that the site you want to create can not be best achieved with
   WordPress as the Content Management System.
