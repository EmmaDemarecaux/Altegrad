Description

   The WP-Members membership plugin turns your WordPress site into a
   membership site. Restrict premium content, create custom registration
   fields, and more.

Membership Sites. Simplified.

   You need a membership site, but you want to focus on your business, not
   mastering a plugin. WP-Members is simple to use, easy to set up, yet
   flexible in every way imaginable.

   The plugin restricts selected WordPress content to registered site
   members. WP-Members puts the registration process on the site front end
   so it is part of your content instead of the native WP login page.
   WP-Members requires no modifications to your theme while remaining
   scalable for users who want to customize the look and feel, or want to
   restrict only some content. It is a great tool for sites offering
   premium content to subscribers and is adaptable to a variety of
   applications.

   Simple to install and configure â€“ yet customizable and scalable!

FonctionnalitÃ©s :

     * Restrict or hide posts, pages, and custom post types
     * User login, registration, and profile integrated into your theme
     * Login widget
     * Create custom registration and profile fields
     * Notifier lâ€™administrateur dâ€™une nouvelle inscription
     * Hold new registrations for admin approval
     * Create post excerpt teaser content automatically
     * Shortcodes for login, registration, content restriction, and more
     * Create powerful customizations with more than 120 action and filter
       hooks
     * A library of API functions for extensibility

   WP-Members allows you to restrict content as restricted or hidden,
   limiting access to registered users.

   A full Users Guide is available here. The guide outlines the
   installation process, and also documents how to use all of the
   settings.

Captures dâ€™Ã©cran

       plugin.

       options tab).
     * Posts > Edit Post - The plugin adds a meta box to the post/page
       editor allowing you to set an individual post to be blocked or
       unblocked (the opposite of whatver your default setting is).
     * Responsive forms.

Installation

   WP-Members is designed to run Â« out-of-the-box Â» with no modifications
   to your WP installation necessary. Please follow the installation
   instructions below. Most of the support issues that arise are a result
   of improper installation or simply not reading/following directions.

Basic Install:

   The best way to begin is to review the Initial Setup Video. There is
   also a complete Users Guide available that covers all of the pluginâ€™s
   features in depth.
    1. Upload the /wp-members/ directory and its contents to the
       /wp-content/plugins/ directory
    2. Activate the plugin through the â€˜Pluginsâ€™ menu in WordPressÂ®

   You are ready to begin using WP-Members. Now follow the instructions
   titled Â« Locking down your site Â» below.

Locking down your site:

     * To restrict posts, you will need to use the <!--more--> link in
       your posts. Content above to the Â« more Â» split will display on
       summary pages (home, archive, category) but the user will be
       required to login to view the entire post. You may also use the
       pluginâ€™s auto excerpt setting to create post excerpts
       automatically. If you do not use the Â« more Â» tag or the auto
       excerpt setting, full post content is going to show on archive
       templates, unless the post is marked as hidden.
     * To begin restricting pages, change the plugin default setting for
       pages to be blocked. Unlike posts, the <!--more--> link is not
       necessary in the blocking of pages, but must be used if you have
       the Â« show excerpts Â» setting turned on for pages.
     * To protect comments, we recommend setting Â« Users must be
       registered and logged in to comment Â» under Settings > Discussion.
     * On the Settings > General page, it is recommended that you uncheck
       Â« Anyone can register Â». While not required, this will prevent WPâ€™s
       native registration from colliding with WP-Members, especially if
       you are using any of the WP-Members additional registration fields.
     * Under Settings > Reading, Â« For each article in a feed, show Â» is
       recommended to be set to Â« Summary. Â» WordPress installs with full
       feed settings by default. If you donâ€™t change this, your feeds will
       show full content.

Additional Setup Information

   There are also some special pages that can be created with simple
   shortcodes:
     * A User Profile page where registered members can edit their
       information and change/reset their password: [wpmem_profile]
     * A Registration page available for those that need a specific URL
       for registrations (such as email marketing or banner ad landing
       pages). Note: this is strictly optional as a registration form can
       also be included by default on blocked content pages: [wpmem_form
       register]
     * A Login page. This is also an optional page as the login form is
       included by default on blocked content. But if you need a specific
       login page, this can be created with a simple shortcode:
       [wpmem_form login]
     * And more shortcodes are available!

   Powerful cusotmizations can be constructed with over 120 action and
   filter hooks, as well as user accessible functions.

Excellent plugin, excellent support.

   ihopethiswillfi 15 aoÃ»t 2019
   Excellent plugin, excellent support.

Chrome plus this plugin disabled siteâ€¦

   ralphw 23 aoÃ»t 2019
   In Firefox, all is well. In Chrome, however, (both on laptop and phone
   browser), all menu links led to just one page, and a second-level page,
   at that. It also blew apart the formatting of the Contact 7 Form on
   that page. I disabled all plugins, changed themes, and this plugin was
   the culprit. Cheers! ----8/23/19 Follow-Up---- Point taken, Chad...! As
   said initially, despite changing themes for troubleshooting, and by
   this I mean using the plain vanilla WP "Twenty Sixteen" theme, your
   plugin was not playing well with my site when viewed with Chrome. As I
   found another plugin to suit me for those needs, and as I did not have
   the time or interest to experiment to see if one of my 16 other
   activated plugins was the cause of making your plugin not work in
   Chrome, I wrote the above review from a sense of frustration. I did not
   intend to nuke your stats! So, adjustment made, and hopefully I am the
   only one that this issue ever happens to. Cheers, Ralph

Very good plugin and awesome support

   This plugin works very nicely, but the best part is the support. Chad
   is one of the most helpful plugin developers we have ever come across,
   and is always happy to help us even with customisations to certain
   features. Highly recommended.
