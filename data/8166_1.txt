big â€˜ole magnet board / job chart

   Posted by hayley
   Tweet

   We have a rule in our family about buying toys. For birthdays and
   Christmas, we parents will buy toys on the wish lists as gifts. Any
   other time of the year, our kids have to purchase themselves things
   they want, but donâ€™t need. The genius of this is three-fold: we end up
   with a lot less toy clutter in the house, there are rarely arguments in
   stores about buying them things, and it teaches our children important
   lessons about managing their own money.

   Both kids have jobs and, just like in the real world, if you do your
   work you get paid. Donâ€™t feel like making your bed? Thatâ€™s ok, but you
   forfeit your pay. Each kid has 5 age-appropriate jobs that will earn
   them $1/day if completed. We pay in cash each night. This keeps them
   motivated to contribute to household tasks in a meaningful way, as well
   as earn an income to buy their â€œwants.â€

   A few years back, I DIYed a job chart for Songbird. But I never got
   around to making one for Bug â€“ until today! Itâ€™s massive and serves as
   both a chart and a magnetic board for him to keep his special
   papers/postcards/etc.

   Hereâ€™s how you can make one too â€“ for under $30!

   Supplies: Large automotive drip pan (this one is 47â€³x 25â€³ â€“ $14 at
   Walmart), white Con-tact shelf liner paper, scissors, masking tape,
   washi tape (Office Depot has a huge selection), X-acto knife, sharpie,
   large Command strips.

   1. Roll out enough liner paper to cover the height of the board. The
   paper is already 18â€³ wide, which is plenty â€“ so cut a piece a few
   inches longer than the pan on each end.

   2. Line up the left edge of the shelf liner with the left edge of the
   drip pan. Use a small piece of masking or painterâ€™s tape on both sides
   to hold the liner paper in place until you get it started.

   3. Beginning at one short side, slowly pull the back protective paper
   off of the liner paper to expose the adhesive. Make sure you push it
   flat into the crease by the lip of the drip pan. Use your hand to make
   it real smooth as you go â€“ you wanna be the tortoise here, not the
   hare.

   4. Come back and run your X-Acto blade carefully around the crease to
   remove the excess liner paper.

   5. Use washi tape to create 2â€³ boxes for the job chart. Write in the
   days of the week with a Sharpie.

   6. Our kidâ€™s jobs change annually, so I didnâ€™t want to write them on
   permanently. Instead, I designed and printed little cards that I then
   self-laminated (because Iâ€™m a nerd like that) and stuck adhesive
   magnetic buttons to the back!

   7. Attach large Command strips on the back of the drip pan at each
   corner and hang that baby up!

   7. Completed tasks are marked with small magnets. Read the tutorial on
   how we turned Bugâ€™s bottlecap collection into magnets or make cute
   wooden star ones like we did for Songbirdâ€™s chart.

   Bug has always been motivated by money â€“ heâ€™s our â€œholes in pocketsâ€
   kid. But this huge chart and all those shiny bottlecaps have just upped
   his level of enthusiasm for the work he has to do to earn the
   dolla-dolla billz.

   So, while we donâ€™t buy our kids a lot of toysâ€¦ we do give them plenty
   of opportunity to earn the money themselves and we try to make it fun!

a collection of caps

   THIS POST CONTAINS AFFILIATE LINKS

   As little boys do, Bug collects things; sticks, rocks, hotwheels cars,
   those fake junkmail credit cards. But one thing heâ€™s passionate about
   acquiring is bottlecaps. He finds them on the beach and in parking lots
   â€“ all sorts of unsavory places. They each get an immediate â€œbathâ€ with
   the hand sanitizer I keep in my purse and then go into a little
   cardboard box in his closet.

   Itâ€™s like legit treasure every time he spots a new one and his
   excitement for the hunt hasnâ€™t waned. So I wanted to find a fun way to
   display them in his new room. I considered a shadowbox or one of these
   bottlecap displays, but both of those options would restrict his love
   of handling them.

   I decided to turn them into magnets. And if you have some bottlecaps
   laying around, you can too!

   Pick up a pack of these 3/4 magnetic buttons. I found mine at Walmart,
   but Iâ€™m sure craft stores and Amazon have them too. There is foam
   adhesive version of these that I tried first, but found that it doesnâ€™t
   stick well to the back of the cap.

   Using industrial strength adhesive (I like E6000), first glue 2 magnets
   together. The depth of one magnet was juuuust shy of being tall enough
   to really magnetize the cap properly and stacking 2 of them keeps the
   sharp edges of the bottlecap up off the surface â€“ preventing scratches.

   Now glue your magnets inside your bottlecap. Be sure to read the
   adhesive instructions: with E6000 you put glue on each piece first,
   wait 2 minutes, then marry the surfaces. Give them 24 hrs to dry.

   So stinking cute. But these arenâ€™t just cool magnets â€“ they have a
   purpose! Come back tomorrow to find out exactly how weâ€™re using them in
   Bugâ€™s room.

a new chapter

   Posted by hayley
   Tweet

   Itâ€™s officially a traditionâ€¦ pictures in the trees on the first morning
   of the school year.
   (Umâ€¦ can we talk about how Bugâ€™s feet are now just one size smaller
   than Songbirdâ€™s?!)

   Having completed her first-phase braces this summer, Songbird is headed
   to 3rd grade with a big straight smile! This year will be a new
   experience for her as she transitions to a â€œswitch classâ€ format: half
   the day with one teacher for reading/writing and the other half with a
   different one for math, science, and social studies. Even more unique
   is that her set of team teachers are a married couple!

   When I asked Songbird what her favorite part of summer was she replied,
   â€œBack to school shopping and going back to school.â€ LOL. Iâ€™m glad she
   has such a deep love of learning! And her pick for new school shoes
   couldnâ€™t be more â€œherâ€ (watermelon high-top Converse).

   Bye bye, preschoolâ€¦ Bug is now a Kindergartner! In Virginia Beach, itâ€™s
   still only 1/2 day but he is pumped to spend the mornings at the same
   school as Songbird. Not entirely sure how heâ€™ll manage 4 hours without
   a snack break â€“ this kid is always hungry!

   One thing I know without a doubt is that heâ€™ll bring his special brand
   of comedy along for the ride.

   Handsome was able to be here for the exciting walk to the bus stop. For
   3 years, Bug has watched Songbird get on that big yellow bus; now his
   time has come!

   His smile was ear to ear as he climbed aboard â€“ not a single tear in
   sight. Upon returning home, he confirmed that magical ride with no seat
   belts and a ton of other kids was just what Kindergarten dreams are
   made of.

treasure rocks

   Posted by hayley

   It all started with a rock that Songbird found on a playground. A rock
   painted like a bluebird, actually. It had been hidden as part of a new
   activity to cultivate joy in our Va Beach community called 757Rocks.
   The premise is simple â€“ painted rocks are hidden all around town for
   anyone to find and bring a smile to their day. Each rock has
   â€œ#757rocksâ€ painted on the back which (when searched) will invite the
   finder to paint and hide new rocks of their own to join in the fun.

   Well, the bluebird rock had a major prize attached! The gal who hid the
   rock was Christy Keane, a local professional photographer. Songbird won
   us a photo shoot at a location of our choice. Major score! We chose the
   hiking trails and sand dunes of the Back Bay nature preserve where we
   often get out and walk as a family.

   As moms it is so important for us to get into pictures with our kids (I
   wrote in depth about embracing the camera in this post from 2014). Most
   of my attempts are goofy-faced iPhone selfiesâ€”which of course have
   their own merit. But what a treat to find myself on the other side of a
   professional lens! Photos by the Bay | greyhouseharbor.com

   I wanted genuine pictures of who we are right now (what we wear, our
   hairstyles, etc), so I told Handsome and the kids to dress however made
   them comfortable, without regard for matching or fussing with details.
   The resulting images couldnâ€™t be more â€œusâ€ : super casual with a hint
   of fun.

   For a mom who is always behind the camera, these photos with my little
   ones are such a rare gift that I will treasure forever!

   Now weâ€™re painting and hiding our own 757rocks to keep the joy going.
   If youâ€™re in the Virginia Beach area, do yourself a favor and be sure
   to check out Christy Keane Photography the next time you too want
   something other than selfies with your family. You wonâ€™t regret it.
