     * About Twitter's account suggestions

About Twitter's account suggestions

   Account suggestions on Twitter are based on many factors, including
   your address book contacts (if you have chosen to upload them) as well
   as patterns from your following history. These suggestions are
   generated by algorithms, which means you may or may not know the
   accounts or find them relevant.

How does Twitter find accounts to suggest?

   Twitterâ€™s account suggestions are based on algorithms that make
   personalized suggestions for you. You may see suggestions based on
   criterion such as:
     * If youâ€™ve uploaded your contacts to Twitter, weâ€™ll suggest you
       connect with those who already have Twitter accounts.
     * If someone has uploaded their contacts to Twitter, and your email
       address or phone number is included in their contacts, we may
       suggest you follow them.
     * Twitter may also make suggestions based on your location, such as
       the city or country you are in.
     * We may make suggestions based on your activity on Twitter, such as
       your Tweets, who you follow, and accounts and Tweets that you view
       or otherwise interact with.
     * If your settings permit, we may make personalized suggestions based
       on your visits to third-party websites that integrate Twitter
       content. Learn more.
     * Twitter may include Promoted Accounts as suggestions for accounts
       for you to follow. Read more about Promoted Accounts here.
     * Recommendations delivered to you via email or through Twitter will
       not suggest content that includes your muted words and hashtags.
       Learn more about advanced muting options here.

How do I control suggestions about my account?

   Email or phone number discoverability

   You can control whether we will suggest your account to someone else
   who has your email address or phone number in their contacts by
   adjusting your privacy settings. For more information and instructions
   about adjusting your settings, read this article.

   Account suggestions based on imported contacts

   When you upload your contacts to Twitter, these contacts may appear as
   suggested accounts for you to follow. Conversely, your account may
   appear as a suggestion for others to follow. You can control whether
   Twitter will use your address book to suggest your account to others by
   adjusting the privacy settings that let others find you by your email
   address or phone number.

   You can also remove contacts youâ€™ve previously uploaded. When you
   remove previously uploaded contacts, we will no longer make suggestions
   based on those contacts, but we may make similar suggestions based on
   who you already follow, and other factors. For more information and
   instructions for removing previously imported contacts, see this
   article.

Twitter is suggesting an account belonging to someone who is deceased

   Please report the account information to Twitter. Learn how to contact
   Twitter about a deceased family member's account.

     * Our use of cookies and similar technologies

Our use of cookies and similar technologies

   Our services use cookies and other similar technologies, such as pixels
   or local storage, to help provide you with a better, faster, and safer
   experience. Here are some of the ways that our services, including our
   various websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications,
   buttons, widgets, and ads, use these technologies: to log you into
   Twitter and Periscope, save your preferences, personalize the content
   you see, protect against spam and abuse, and show you more relevant
   ads.

   Below we explain how Twitter, our partners, and other third parties use
   these technologies, your privacy settings, and the other options you
   have.

What are cookies, pixels, and local storage?

   Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you
   browse the web. Like many websites, Twitter, Periscope, and our other
   services use cookies to discover how people are using our services and
   to make them work better.

   A pixel is a small amount of code on a web page or in an email
   notification. As many services do, we use pixels to learn whether
   youâ€™ve interacted with certain web or email content. This helps us
   measure and improve our services and personalize your experience.

   Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website
   or application to store information locally on your computer or mobile
   device. We use local storage to customize what we show you based on
   your past interactions with our services.

Why do our services use these technologies?

   Our services use these technologies to deliver, measure, and improve
   our services in various ways. These uses generally fall into one of the
   following categories:
     * Authentication and security:
          + To log you into Twitter and Periscope.
          + To protect your security.
          + To let you to view content with limited distribution.
          + To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities
            that violate the Twitter Rules and the Periscope Community
            Guidelines.
          + For example, these technologies help authenticate your access
            to Twitter and Periscope and prevent unauthorized parties from
            accessing your account. They also let us show you appropriate
            content through our services.
     * Preferences:
          + To remember information about your browser and your
            preferences.
          + For example, cookies help us remember your preferred language
            or the country that you are in. We can then provide you with
            Twitter and Periscope content in your preferred language
            without having to ask you each time you visit Twitter or
            Periscope. On Twitter, we can also customize content based on
            your country, such as showing you what topics are trending
            near you, or to withhold certain content based on applicable
            local laws. Learn more about trends and country withheld
            content.
     * Analytics and research:
          + To help us improve and understand how people use our services,
            including Twitter buttons and widgets, and Twitter Ads.
          + For example, cookies help us test different versions of our
            services to see which particular features or content users
            prefer. We might also optimize and improve your experience on
            Twitter and Periscope by using cookies to see how you interact
            with our services, such as when and how often you use them and
            what links you click on. We may use Google Analytics to assist
            us with this. Learn more about the cookies you may encounter
            through our use of Google Analytics. We might also use cookies
            to count the number of users that have seen a particular
            embedded Tweet or timeline. Learn more about the analytics
            cookies used by Twitter for Websites widgets.
     * Personalized content:
          + To customize our services with more relevant content, like
            tailored trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to
            follow.
          + For example, local storage tells us which parts of your
            Twitter timeline or Periscope Global Feed you have viewed
            already so that we can show you the appropriate new content.
            Cookies can help us make smarter and more relevant suggestions
            about who you might enjoy following based on your visits to
            websites that have integrated Twitter embeds, including
            embedded timelines.
     * Advertising:
          + To help us deliver ads, measure their performance, and make
            them more relevant to you based on criteria like your activity
            on Twitter and visits to our ad partners' websites.
          + For example, we use cookies and pixels to personalize ads and
            measure their performance. Using these technologies, we can
            show you ads and evaluate their effectiveness based on your
            visits to our ad partners' websites. This helps advertisers
            provide high-quality ads and content that might be more
            interesting to you.
          + We also work with third-party advertising partners, including
            Google, to market our services and serve ads on behalf of our
            advertisers, including through the delivery of interest-based
            ads.
     * Personalization across devices:
          + By better understanding how devices are related, we can use
            information from one device to help personalize the Twitter
            experience on another device.
          + When you log in to Twitter on a device, we associate that
            device with your Twitter account. Whether or not you are
            logged in to Twitter, we may also receive information about
            your devices when, for example, that information is shared by
            a partner; you visit Twitter.com; you visit third-party
            websites that integrate Twitter content; or you visit a
            Twitter advertiserâ€™s website or mobile application. We may use
            this information, most commonly IP addresses and the time at
            which the information was received, to infer that certain
            devices are associated with one another, including the devices
            on which you log in to Twitter. To learn more about the
            devices associated with your account, check out Your Twitter
            Data while logged in. To learn more about the other devices
            associated with the device or browser you are currently using,
            visit Your Twitter Data while logged out.

Where are these technologies used?

   We (along with third parties) use these technologies on our websites,
   applications, and services and on other websites, applications, and
   services that have integrated our services, including third-party
   properties that incorporate our advertising technology. This includes
   our ad partnersâ€™ websites and sites that use our embeds, including
   embedded timelines. Third parties may also use these technologies, for
   example, when you click on links from our websites or applications,
   view or interact with third-party content from within our services, or
   visit third-party websites that incorporate our advertising technology.

What are my privacy options?

   We are committed to offering you meaningful privacy choices. You have a
   number of options to control or limit how we, our partners, and other
   third parties use cookies:
     * To control whether Twitter stores information about other websites
       where youâ€™ve seen Twitter content, adjust the Track where you see
       Twitter content across the web setting in your Personalization and
       data settings. If you have this setting disabled or are in the
       European Union or EFTA States, Twitter will not store or use such
       web page visits to improve your experience in the future. If weâ€™ve
       previously stored your web browsing history, your experience may
       continue to be personalized based on information already inferred
       from that history.
     * If you do not want Twitter to show you interest-based ads on and
       off of Twitter, there are several ways to turn off this feature:
          + Using your Twitter settings, visit the Personalization and
            data settings and adjust the setting Personalize ads.
          + If you are on the web, you can visit the Digital Advertising
            Allianceâ€™s consumer choice tool at optout.aboutads.info to opt
            out of seeing interest-based advertising from Twitter in your
            current browser.
          + If you do not want Twitter to show you interest-based ads in
            Twitter for iOS on your current mobile device, enable the
            â€œLimit Ad Trackingâ€ setting in your iOS phoneâ€™s settings.
          + If you do not want Twitter to show you interest-based ads in
            Twitter for Android on your current mobile device, enable â€œOpt
            out of Ads Personalizationâ€ in your Android phoneâ€™s settings.
     * To control personalization across devices on Twitter, visit your
       Personalization and data settings and adjust the Personalize across
       all your devices setting. This will control whether we link your
       account to browsers or devices other than the ones you use to log
       into Twitter (or if youâ€™re logged out, whether we link the browser
       or device youâ€™re currently using to any other browsers or devices).
     * To control interest-based advertising from certain third-party
       advertising partners, you can learn more about opting out of
       receiving interest-based ads at optout.aboutads.info and
       www.networkadvertising.org/choices. If you are on the web, you can
       also opt out of Google Analytics by installing Googleâ€™s opt-out
       browser add-on, and opt out of interest-based Google ads using
       Googleâ€™s Ads Settings.
     * To control cookies, you can modify your settings in most web
       browsers to accept or deny cookies or to request your permission
       each time a site attempts to set a cookie. Although cookies are not
       required for some parts of our services, Twitter and Periscope may
       not work properly if you disable cookies entirely. For example, you
       cannot log into twitter.com or pscp.tv if you've disabled all
       cookie use.

   Note: Please confirm that you are logged in if you want to view or
   change the web settings for your Twitter account. Changing your Twitter
   settings in your web browser when you are logged out will only affect
   behavior on that browser while you are not logged in to Twitter. Learn
   more about how to access your Personalization and data settings,
   including in your Twitter mobile app.
