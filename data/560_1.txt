Big Data & IA : Une √©trange ressemblance‚Ä¶ Revue de concepts

   QU‚ÄôEST-CE QUE L‚ÄôINTELLIGENCE ARTIFICIELLE ?
   Selon l‚Äôun de ses cr√©ateurs, Marvin Lee Minsky en 1956, l‚ÄôIntelligence
   Artificielle serait une forme d√©g√©n√©r√©e d‚Äôintelligence humaine, ou ‚Äì √†
   tout le moins ‚Äì une p√¢le copie encore inaboutie du cerveau humain.

DATA SCIENTISTS, CDO, DPO‚Ä¶ LA NOUVELLE G√âN√âRATION DATA

   nouveaux h√©rauts du Big
   Data transforment le fonctionnement de l‚Äôentreprise √† l‚Äô√®re du digital
   et de la data.
   Leur objectif commun : emprunter le virage de la ¬´ data-driven
   organization ¬ª. Avec
   parfois des caract√©ristiques communes et des ¬´ overlaps ¬ª.

Hadoop, Map reduce‚Ä¶ retour sur 10 ans d‚Äôinnovations technologiques

   Retour sur ces technologies qui ont chang√© le visage de l‚Äôanalytique
   Hadoop, Mapreduce, Yarn, Spark‚Ä¶ Si ces noms n‚Äô√©voquent rien au
   n√©ophyte, ils rassemblent √† leur seule √©vocation tous les fantasmes
   d‚Äôune d√©c√©nnie sur le traitement g√©n√©ralis√© des Big Data.

Big Data, retour sur 10 ans de conqu√™te

   Le 22 d√©cembre 2008, au sein de la prestigieuse Computing Research
   Association am√©-ricaine, trois chercheurs des universit√©s de Carnegie
   Mellon, Berkeley et Washington ‚Äì respectivement : Randal E. Bryant,
   Randy H. Katz et Edward D. Lazowska ‚Äì publient un white paper intitul√©
   ¬´ Big-Data Computing: Creating Revolutionary Breakthroughs in Commerce,
