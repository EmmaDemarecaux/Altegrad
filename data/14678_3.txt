What To Expect From XXXTentacion's Second Posthumous Album

   XXXTentacion

   A little over a year after XXXTentacion (born Jahseh Onfroy) was shot
   and killed outside a Florida motorcycle dealership, his second
   posthumous album, Bad Vibes Forever, will be released this fall. Xâ€™s
   manager and Sounds Music Group CEO Solomon Sobande describes it as â€œthe
   love child between 17 and ?,â€ the two albums X released during his
   lifetime. Along with Nima Etminan, vp at EMPIRE (which releases Xâ€™s
   music), he spoke about assembling Bad Vibes and the artistâ€™s complex
   legacy.

   How did you approach putting the album together?

   Sobande: A lot of records, like â€œSchool Shooterâ€ featuring Lil Wayne or
   â€œHearteater,â€ Jahseh saved for this point in his career when he was
   more established, so they would be better received. A lot of things he
   had worked on, almost complete ideas, werenâ€™t finished -- maybe [they]
   only had one verse and a hook or only a beat. To fill out those songs,
   a whoâ€™s who of the music industry came out to help us.

   Who did that include?

   Sobande: The executive producer is Cleopatra Bernard, Jahsehâ€™s mother,
   who pieced everything together with the creatives who worked with
   Jahseh. John Cunningham, Jahâ€™s right-hand man, produced the majority of
   the album. Thereâ€™s outside production from DJ Carnage and JonFX. For
   â€œRoyalty,â€ featuring Ky-Mani Marley, Stefflon Don and Vybz Kartel, Jah
   did the song with Ky-Mani, and after he passed, his mom set it up so I
   could go to Jamaica, visit Vybz in jail and get his verse.

   Are there other features?

   Sobande: Thereâ€™s a healthy amount. Tory Lanez and Mavado; thereâ€™s a
   country song featuring Lil Nas X. One of the most surprising is
   Blink-182 -- one of Jahâ€™s favorite bands.

   Did his mother have final approval?

   Etminan: His motherâ€™s word remains the most important thing, along with
   the people who worked most closely with him. I was a young hip-hop fan
   when 2Pac passed away. I remember 2Pac albums coming out and being
   upset about people who had no relation to him being put on records. So
   now that Iâ€™m working on a project for someone who was taken away from
   us too early, I want to make sure I satisfy the kids in the position I
   was in.

   The domestic violence charges against X heavily inform his legacy. How
   does that influence you?

   Sobande: I knew him personally, and he wasnâ€™t the person those charges
   said he was. He had his share of problems, mental health issues. But he
   was making every effort to change. Part of the responsibility for me
   and his team is to expose that person who was trying to be better.
