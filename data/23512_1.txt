Get it together and manage projects the right way.

   Before Basecamp: Projects feel scattered, things slip, itâ€™s tough to
   see where things stand, and people are stressed. After Basecamp:
   Everythingâ€™s organized in one place, youâ€™re on top of things, progress
   is clear, and a sense of calm sets in.

   here's what a Basecamp project looks like

One place, not all over the place.

   Projects are a struggle when stuff's spread out across emails, file
   services, task managers, spreadsheets, chats, meetings, etc. Things get
   lost, you donâ€™t know where to look for stuff, and people put the right
   information in the wrong place. Not good.

   But when itâ€™s all together in Basecamp, youâ€™ll see where everything is,
   understand what everyoneâ€™s working on, and know exactly where to put
   the next thing everyone needs to know about. This is the modern way â€“
   The Basecamp Way to Work.
